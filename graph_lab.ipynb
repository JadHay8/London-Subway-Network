    "Design Pattern Choices:\n",
    "In our program we utilized two instances of the strategy design pattern and a strong object-oriented architecture to accomplish the functionality of the project. We decided that implementing the strategy design pattern was an appropriate choice for creating both graph metrics and graph algorithms for multiple reasons. By choosing Strategy we are able to easily add more metric extractions and graph algorithms to our software while also allowing us to safely remove specific functionalities without breaking existing code catering to the open/closed principle. Strategy also required us to create a separate class for each task, allowing us to achieve the single responsibility principle which makes the code more readable and maintainable. In addition, each low level metric extraction and algorithm class depends on abstractions which decouples the dependencies and allows for easier re-use of functionality. By defining a family of algorithms, it allows a specific algorithm to be chosen and switched at runtime which was helpful when benchmarking and testing our code.\n"

For this reason, we have simply decided to delegate the responsibility between the BuildGraph and Graph classes. BuildGraph is a graph builder responsible for extracting the data from the csv files and depends on the Graph class to actually construct the graph for the transit system. The Graph class is what actually takes in nodes and edges and puts together an adjacency list to represent the graph. It also houses other context for the nodes such as the weight of an edge, and the transit line a certain node is on. This again follows the single responsibility and separation of concerns principle."

Originally, we planned to identify paths of the same lengths and call a method from the itinerary class to see which path had less line changes. After implementing our algorithms however, we noticed our algorithms would strictly return the first occurrence of a shortest path in the graph, regardless if there were multiple of the same length. The only solution to this problem with our original implementation was to run the algorithm to find the shortest path, then remove the edges in this path and run the algorithm again to see if there was another path with equal length, and pass these two paths into the itinerary function to find which path had less transfers. This solution simply increased the run time of our algorithms too much, thus we decided to take a different route.\n",

To accomplish this we integrated some new logic into the algorithms that would add a weight to a given path to simulate the amount of time it takes to change lines. With this change, the algorithms only needed to execute once and find the shortest path for the user, including the considerations of line transfers. If there was an equal length path with the same amount of line changes there is no issue with our algorithm only returning the first occurrence as they would essentially be equivalent.\n"

    "Our benchmarking consists of a BenchmarkSpace class which depends on the GraphAlgoInterface. Within this class we have implemented a method “withNbStations’ which is given a list of integers and generates a random graph with the corresponding number of nodes for each integer. This list of graphs can then be passed into either “withOpsAlgoStrategies” or “withTimeAlgoStrategies” alongside the corresponding KPI algorithm, start node, and end node. These functions will run on each graph storing the metrics into an array. To increase code reusability, this array is passed to a function which is solely responsible for extracting the metrics into a Dijksta and AStar list, after which we can return the output. While we were originally planning to run our benchmarking using pyperf, we decided upon this implementation due to its compatibility to our existing strategy pattern. We are able to lean on the flexibility of our strategy design pattern and easily call which GraphicAlgoInterface class we need in order to compute our KPI’s.  In addition, this implementation allows this class to adhere to the interface segregation principle as this class isn’t forced to depend on methods or classes it does not use. \n",

This way it was easy to compile all the KPIs and measure our algorithms in an effective and clear way. By doing it like this, every operation was taken into account by the benchmark and it was easier to interpret the results and the significance of them."

    "In the previous week we had a very simple and flawed implementation of our benchmarking. We counted our KPI’s and execution time in the same file as the pathfinding algorithms and returned all three variables. This implementation was wrong for many reasons. Incrementing a count variable throughout the algorithms reduced the readability of the code. In addition, whenever we needed to access a specific value from the benchmarking space (such as time), we needed to call the function and create variables for both path and ops while only passing the variable we were using to carry out the rest of the execution. This ruined the Open Closed and Single Responsibility principles from our design pattern as we were calculating three different outputs at once. \n",

Not only did this increase the readability of our algorithms and benchmark, it made executing and plotting the benchmarks smoother as well. In addition, if we ever needed to add or remove functionality of our benchmark it would be much easier and makes our code more maintainable. Lastly, this implementation adheres to the dependency inversion principle as these entities depend on abstractions and not concretions which allows for greater decoupling.\n"

First, there was simply far too much to accomplish for 2 people who have little to no background knowledge or experience implementing anything of the sort - especially at such a scale - which was just demoralizing and gave a sense of constant incompleteness. Second, the concept and realization of benchmarking and thorough testing was something we have not learned at all and was difficult and rigorous to figure out - not enjoyable.
